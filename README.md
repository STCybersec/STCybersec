# 👋 Welcome

I'm Sanele Siyabonga Thusi, a cybersecurity student and aspiring specialist, currently immersed in **purple teaming**. My work focuses on **real-world lab simulations**, threat detection, network monitoring, ethical exploitation, log analysis, and **security governance alignment**. I actively assist SMEs with cybersecurity-related issues on the Virtual Routes platform.

## 🛡️ Areas of Focus

- **SOC Operations** – SIEM alerting, log parsing, custom rule creation and tuning (Wazuh, Splunk, OSSEC, Suricata)  
- **Threat Detection & Blue Teaming** – File integrity monitoring (FIM), unauthorized access tracking, privilege escalation alerts, endpoint visibility  
- **Purple Teaming** – Mapping red team techniques to blue team detections, MITRE ATT&CK alignment, detection gap analysis, alert validation  
- **Red Team Practice (Ethical)** – Network enumeration, payload delivery, reverse shells, stealth scanning and evasion techniques  
- **Linux Mastery** – Kali Linux full-time, Bash scripting, system hardening, logging and service monitoring  
- **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** –  
  - NIST CSF 2.0 (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)  
  - ISO/IEC 27001 control awareness and evidence alignment  
  - CIS Critical Security Controls mapping to technical detections  
  - POPIA (South Africa) data protection, breach awareness, and lawful processing  
- **Hands-On Projects** – Real devices, real networks, ethical simulations with measurable detection and compliance outcomes
