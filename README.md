# 👋 Welcome

I'm **Sanele Siyabonga Thusi**, a **Hybrid Cybersecurity & Data/Automation Specialist**. My work spans **security operations, threat detection, automation, analytics, and business system integration**. I actively design and implement **real-world lab simulations, security controls, data-driven dashboards, automated processes, and cloud-enabled solutions**.

I focus on creating measurable outcomes for both **security defense** and **enterprise operations efficiency**.

## 🛡️ Pillar 1: Cybersecurity

**Focus Areas**
- **SOC Operations:** SIEM alerting, log parsing, custom rule creation & tuning (Wazuh, Splunk, OSSEC, Suricata)  
- **Threat Detection & Blue Teaming:** File integrity monitoring (FIM), unauthorized access tracking, privilege escalation alerts, endpoint visibility  
- **Purple Teaming:** Mapping adversary techniques to defensive detections, MITRE ATT&CK alignment, detection gap analysis, alert validation  
- **Controlled Adversary Simulation:** Network enumeration, payload delivery, reverse shells, stealth scanning, evasion testing for detection validation  
- **Linux Mastery:** Kali Linux navigation, Bash scripting, system hardening, logging & service monitoring  
- **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC):**  
  - NIST CSF 2.0 (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)  
  - ISO/IEC 27001 control awareness & evidence alignment  
  - CIS Critical Security Controls mapping  
  - POPIA (South Africa) – data protection, breach awareness & lawful processing  
- **Hands-On Security Engineering:** Real devices, real networks, controlled simulations with measurable detection & compliance outcomes  

**Key Projects**
- **BlueGuard Wazuh Security Suite** – Detected 100% of simulated unauthorized access events, full FIM baseline, automated malicious file detection. [View Project →](https://github.com/STCybersec/Wazuh-Endpoint-Security)
